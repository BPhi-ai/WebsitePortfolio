            From 2016 to 2019, I was in the Business and Technology Academy during my high school years at San Gabriel High School. At that time, I was a member of the Academy,
            attending classes that is mostly towards technology, if its photoshop or game design, or any other tech class. Towards my senior year, I was the Social Media Manager for 
            BTA, where I manage all of the social media accounts for BTA, to show what the club has to offer for San Gabriel at the time.
